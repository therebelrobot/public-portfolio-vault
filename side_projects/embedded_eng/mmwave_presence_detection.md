title: "Side Projects: Embedded Engineering: mmWave Presence Detection"
---
Using [Seeed Studio's Xiao modules](https://www.seeedstudio.com/xiao-series-page), I'm currently learning how to detect human presence in a non-invasive manner, via the [24GHz mmWave Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-24GHz-mmWave-for-XIAO-p-5830.html)

Long-term, the end goal of these would be not only for home automation, but I'd like to build out smart lighting on my property, similar to those shown in the TV show Devs:

...with the notable difference that I want my version to only engage when a person is nearby. Light pollution in the country is a major problem, and the more I can keep lighting at night focused where it needs to be, the better.

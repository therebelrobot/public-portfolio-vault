If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I thrive on variety. My mind is a buzzing hub of ideas, constantly exploring new horizons. This passion for diverse pursuits has led me to embark on an array of side projects, each uniquely enriching and challenging.

From dabbling in the latest web technologies to experimenting with digital art, every project is a journey into uncharted territory. I've found joy in gardening, where the rhythmic nature of nurturing plants offers a serene counterbalance to the digital world. My musical endeavors, whether it's mastering a new instrument or composing, fuel my creativity in unexpected ways. Below you'll find a number of projects I've worked on that I thoroughly enjoy.

How people interact with their gender identity and sexuality is something that's fascinated me for years, not only because of my own journeys with them, but also how conceptually these out groups have interacted with society as a whole, how they act and interact with each other, and how they support and build each other up in the face of growing public backlash for simply existing.

My work with [SFGMC](volunteer/sfgmc/index) volunteering both as a singer and on their tech task force, and professionally with [Plume Clinic](work/2023may-plume), both highlight this interest, and have helped fuel my interest and community in countless ways.

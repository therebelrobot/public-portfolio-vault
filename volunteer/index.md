I've done quite a bit of volunteering in my time. Here's a snippet of them:

- [Node Ninjas Meetup Groups](volunteer/node_meetup/index)
- [Node.js Foundation Web Working Group](volunteer/nodejs_foundation/index)
- [Code for San Francisco](volunteer/cfsf/index)
- [San Francisco Gay Mens' Chorus](volunteer/sfgmc/index)
